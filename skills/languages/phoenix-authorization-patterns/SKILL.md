  Handles all authorization and access control work in Phoenix and LiveView applications. Covers
  server-side authorization, owner-only patterns, scoped queries, policy modules, controller
  authorization, and authorization testing. Use when writing permission checks, policy modules,
  or role-based access controls, or when addressing authorization, access control, permission,
  policy, role, owner, scoped query, or IDOR concerns.

# Phoenix Authorization Patterns


Canonical FP bar: [`docs/fcis-engineering-rules.md`](../../docs/fcis-engineering-rules.md) — **Functional Core, Imperative Shell**: pure domain modules; side effects at edges. Authorization decisions should be pure checks on scope/user data; persist only at the edge.

## RULES — Follow these with no exceptions

**1.** **Always authorize on the server in event handlers** — never rely on UI-only checks
**2.** **Verify resource ownership by comparing `current_scope.user.id` against the resource's `user_id`** — never trust client-sent user IDs
**3.** **Use policy modules for complex authorization** — don't inline permission checks in LiveViews or controllers
**4.** **Add `data-confirm` attribute for destructive UI actions** — client-side confirmation before server round-trip
**5.** **Test both authorized and unauthorized paths** — every `handle_event` that mutates data needs an authz test
**6.** **Scope queries to the current user in contexts** — `where(user_id: ^user_id)` prevents IDOR vulnerabilities


## Authorization Workflow for a New Resource

Follow these steps in order when adding authorization to any new resource:

1. **Add scoped queries in the context** — ensure all queries filter by `user_id` so unauthorized data is never returned
2. **Define policy module rules** — add clauses for every action (`view`, `edit`, `delete`, etc.) before wiring up any LiveView
3. **Add server-side checks in LiveView event handlers** — call `Policy.authorize/3` or compare `current_scope.user.id` against the resource's `user_id` in every `handle_event` that mutates data
4. **Write unauthorized-path tests first** — confirm that a non-owner receives an error and that the mutation does not occur
5. **Only then add UI controls** — hide or disable buttons for unauthorized users *after* server-side checks are verified

**Validation checkpoints:**
- Every context function that returns or mutates a resource is scoped to the current user ✓
- Policy module has a catch-all clause returning `{:error, :unauthorized}` ✓
- Every mutating `handle_event` has a corresponding unauthorized-path test ✓


## Server-Side Authorization in LiveViews

```elixir
defmodule MyAppWeb.PostLive.Show do
  use MyAppWeb, :live_view

  @impl true
  def handle_event("delete", _params, socket) do
    post = socket.assigns.post

    if socket.assigns.current_scope.user.id == post.user_id do
      {:ok, _} = Blog.delete_post(post)
      {:noreply, push_navigate(socket, to: ~p"/posts")}
    else
      {:noreply, put_flash(socket, :error, "Not authorized")}
    end
  end
end
```


## Scoped Queries in Contexts

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Blog do
  import Ecto.Query

  # Scoped — only returns posts owned by this user
  def list_user_posts(%Scope{user: user}) do
    Post
    |> where(user_id: ^user.id)
    |> order_by(desc: :inserted_at)
    |> Repo.all()
  end

  # Scoped get — returns nil if not owned by user
  def get_user_post(%Scope{user: user}, id) do
    Post
    |> where(user_id: ^user.id)
    |> Repo.get(id)
  end

  # Scoped update — only updates if owned
  def update_user_post(%Scope{user: user}, %Post{} = post, attrs) do
    if post.user_id == user.id do
      post |> Post.changeset(attrs) |> Repo.update()
    else
      {:error, :unauthorized}
    end
  end
end
```


## Policy Modules

For complex permissions (roles, teams, org-level access):

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Policy do
  alias MyApp.Accounts.User
  alias MyApp.Blog.Post

  def authorize(%User{role: :admin}, _action, _resource), do: :ok

  def authorize(%User{id: user_id}, :edit, %Post{user_id: user_id}), do: :ok
  def authorize(%User{id: user_id}, :delete, %Post{user_id: user_id}), do: :ok
  def authorize(%User{}, :view, %Post{published: true}), do: :ok

  def authorize(_user, _action, _resource), do: {:error, :unauthorized}
end

# Usage in LiveView
case Policy.authorize(user, :delete, post) do
  :ok -> {:ok, _} = Blog.delete_post(post)
  {:error, :unauthorized} -> put_flash(socket, :error, "Not authorized")
end
```


## Testing Authorization

```elixir
describe "authorization" do
  test "owner can delete their post", %{conn: conn} do
    user = user_fixture()
    post = post_fixture(user_id: user.id)
    conn = log_in_user(conn, user)

    {:ok, lv, _html} = live(conn, ~p"/posts/#{post}")
    lv |> element("button", "Delete") |> render_click()
    assert_redirect(lv, ~p"/posts")
  end

  test "non-owner cannot delete post", %{conn: conn} do
    owner = user_fixture()
    other_user = user_fixture()
    post = post_fixture(user_id: owner.id)
    conn = log_in_user(conn, other_user)

    {:ok, lv, _html} = live(conn, ~p"/posts/#{post}")
    refute render(lv) =~ "Delete"
    assert render_click(lv, "delete") =~ "Not authorized"
  end
end
```

## Common Pitfalls

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|----------|-------|
| Rely on hidden or disabled UI buttons for access control | Authorize on the server in every `handle_event` |
| Trust a `user_id` sent from the client | Compare `current_scope.user.id` against the resource's `user_id` |
| Query a resource without a user filter | Scope queries with `where(user_id: ^user.id)` to prevent IDOR |
| Inline complex permission logic in LiveViews/controllers | Extract rules into a `Policy` module |
| Omit a catch-all authorize clause | End `Policy` with `def authorize(_, _, _), do: {:error, :unauthorized}` |
| Test only the happy path | Test both authorized and unauthorized paths |
